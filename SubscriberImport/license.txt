Welcome to the Subscriber Import Plugin. This plugin allows you to import a CSV file to create or delete mailing list
subscriptions. Subscriber's are added (or removed) from a named Mailing List and public Site Users with Membership
to the Mailing List are automatically created.
</p>
<p>
If their Subscription is currently 'active' they are by default given Call Alert Subscribe status with frequency set to
Instant. Otherwise status is set to Unsubscribe. It is then up to the User to verify that they want to become active
on the list by completing a subscription verification process.
</p>
<p>
Due to Mura limitations we have to use the Subscriber's <strong>email address</strong> as the 'username'.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-info alert-dismissable"><p>
    BEFORE RUNNING ANY IMPORT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU SET UP A SITE MEMBER USER GROUP WITH EXACTLY THE SAME NAME AS THE MAILING LIST -
    IN EPSRC'S (INITIAL) CASE THIS IS <STRONG>'CALL ALERT'<STRONG>.
